MASM Program from Computer Architecture Course

A MASM program from my Computer Architechture course that sorts random numbers in descending order and displays the median. The user will 
request the number of random numbers to generate and the program will display the numbers unsorted. Next, the program will sort the 
numbers in descending order and display the median. Lastly, the sorted list of numbers will be displayed.
